With directory layout differences between Red Hat, Debian, Suse and
other distros one needs to set the variables for the elements below

-----------------+------------------+---------------+----------------+
                 | RedHat (default) |  Debian       |  Suse          |
-----------------+------------------+---------------+----------------+
CONFIG_LEAF_DIR  | sysconfig        | default       | sysconfig      |
SUBSYS_DIR       | /var/run/subsys  | /var/run      | /var/run       |
INITD_DIR        | /etc/rc.d/init.d | /etc/init.d   | /etc/init.d    |
-----------------+------------------+---------------+----------------+

The build currently defaults to the elements used by Red Hat.
For others, these env variables must be set in the shell env
or modified in Config.mk before running make.

This mechanism sets the location that files are installed to, but does
not change the code itself. Scripts that refer to files affected by these
directories must check each possible location at run time.

To add support for new distributions that don't use the above locations,
one must grep for the above elements and add appropriate checks.

For example if a new distro uses /etc/bork as it's config dir, It's not
sufficient to set CONFIG_LEAF_DIR=bork, one must also add tests for the
existance of the bork dir in every context where config files are read.
