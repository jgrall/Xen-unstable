=head1 NAME

xmdomain.cfg - xm domain create config file format

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 /etc/xen/myxendomain
 /etc/xen/myxendomain2
 /etc/xen/auto/myxenautostarted

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The xm(1) program uses python executable config files to define
domains to create from scratch.  Each of these config files needs to
contain a number of required options, and may specify many more.

Domain configuration files live in /etc/xen by default, though the
full path to the config file must be specified in the I<xm create>
command, so they can exist anywhere in the filesystem.

/etc/xen/auto is a special case however, as domain config files in
that directory will be started automatically at system boot if the
xendomain init script is enabled.

=head1 OPTIONS

The following lists the most commonly used options for a domain config
file.  

=over 4

=item I<kernel>

The kernel image used in the domain.

=item I<ramdisk>

The initial ramdisk to be used in the domain.  Default xen domU
kernels do not usually need a ramdisk.

=item I<memory>

The amount of memory, in megabytes to allocate to the domain when it
starts.  Allocating insufficient memory for a domain may produce
extremely bizarre behavior.

=item I<name>

A unique name for the domain.  You can not create 2 domains with the
same name.

=item I<root>

Root stanza for the domain (required for Linux domains).

=item I<disk>

An array of disk stanzas 

=back

A bare minimal config file example might be as follows:

    kernel = "/boot/vmlinuz-2.6-xenU"
    memory = 128
    name = "MyLinux"      
    root = "/dev/hda1 ro"
