\section{Xensv (web control interface)}
\label{s:xensv}

Xensv is the experimental web control interface for managing a Xen
machine. It can be used to perform some (but not yet all) of the
management tasks that can be done using the xm tool.

It can be started using:
\begin{quote}
  \verb_# xensv start_
\end{quote}
and stopped using:
\begin{quote}
  \verb_# xensv stop_
\end{quote}

By default, Xensv will serve out the web interface on port 8080. This
can be changed by editing
\path{/usr/lib/python2.3/site-packages/xen/sv/params.py}.

Once Xensv is running, the web interface can be used to create and
manage running domains.
