\section{Debugging}
\label{s:keys}

Xen has a set of debugging features that can be useful to try and figure
out what's going on. Hit ``h'' on the serial line (if you specified a baud
rate on the Xen command line) or ScrollLock-h on the keyboard to get a
list of supported commands.

If you have a crash you'll likely get a crash dump containing an EIP
(PC) which, along with an \path{objdump -d image}, can be useful in
figuring out what's happened. Debug a Xenlinux image just as you would
any other Linux kernel.

%% We supply a handy debug terminal program which you can find in
%% \path{/usr/local/src/xen-2.0.bk/tools/misc/miniterm/} This should
%% be built and executed on another machine that is connected via a
%% null modem cable. Documentation is included.  Alternatively, if the
%% Xen machine is connected to a serial-port server then we supply a
%% dumb TCP terminal client, {\tt xencons}.
