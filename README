About the Xen Virtual Machine Monitor
=====================================

"Xen" is a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) originally developed by the
Systems Research Group of the University of Cambridge Computer
Laboratory, as part of the UK-EPSRC funded XenoServers project. 

Xen 2.0 offers excellent performance, hardware support and enterprise
grade features such as live migration.  Linux 2.6, 2.4 and NetBSD 2.0
are already available for Xen, with more operating system ports on the
way.

Xen is Free Open Source Software, released under the GNU GPL.

For full documentation, see the Xen User Manual in docs/user.pdf
(after running make -C docs) or the Documentation page on the Xen
website.
