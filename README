About the Xen Virtual Machine Monitor
=====================================

Xen is a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) originally developed by the
Systems Research Group of the University of Cambridge Computer
Laboratory, as part of the UK-EPSRC funded XenoServers project.

The 2.0 release offers excellent performance, hardware support and
enterprise-grade features such as live migration. Linux 2.6, 2.4 and
NetBSD 2.0 are already available for Xen, with more operating system
ports on the way.

Xen is freely-distributable Open Source software, released under the
GNU GPL.

For full documentation, see the Xen User Manual in docs/pdf/user.pdf
(after running make -C docs) or the Documentation page on the Xen
website.
