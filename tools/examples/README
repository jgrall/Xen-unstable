Xen Control Tools - Examples
===================================

This directory contains example scripts and configurations for Xen.
For many operations you will either be able to use these scripts directly, or
incorporate code from them into your own scripts.

If you write a useful script and would like to share it, please do
send it (preferably with a little summary to go in this file) to
<xen-devel@lists.sourceforge.net> so we can add it to this directory.

network             - default network setup script called by xend at startup.
vif-bridge          - default virtual network interface setup script.
xend-config.sxp     - default xend configuration file.
xmexample1          - example configuration script for 'xm create'.
xmexample2          - a more complex configuration script for 'xm create'.
