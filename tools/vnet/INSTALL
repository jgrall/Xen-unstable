To compile and install run "make install"; if it fails or you need to reinstall 
run "make clean" first or the build will fail, at least that is what I have 
found under 2.6.10.

Other important items:
1)	You will need to have your xen0 kernel compiled with HMAC_SUPPORT 
	2.6.x = (MAIN MENU: Cryptographic Options -> HMAC Support)
	BEFORE running "make install".

2)	You will want at least some of the other alogorithms listed under
	"Cryptographic Options" for the kernel compiled as modules.

3)	You will want the networking IPsec/VLAN options compiled in as modules
	2.6.x = (MAIN MENU: Device Drivers -> Networking Support -> 
				Networking Options ->
					IP: AH transformation
					IP: ESP transformation
					IP: IPComp transformation 
					IP: tunnel transformation

					IPsec user configuration interface
	
					802.1Q VLAN Support

4)	The module (vnet_module) will not properly load from the command line
	with a "modprobe vnet_module".  Use network-vnet to properly configure
	your system and load the module for you.

Please refer to the additional documentation found in tools/vnet/doc for
proper syntax and config file parameters.
