This directory contains the implementation of vnets:
virtual private networks for virtual machines.
See doc/ for more information and examples/ for example
configurations.

The kernel module is in vnet-module/ and the vnet forwarding
daemon is in vnetd/. The vnetd daemon makes vnets work across
subnets when multicast routing is not available.
