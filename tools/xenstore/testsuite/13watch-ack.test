# This demonstrates a bug where an xs_acknowledge_watch returns
# EINVAL, because the daemon doesn't track what watch event it sent
# and relies on it being the "first" watch which has an event.
# Watches firing after the first event is sent out will change this.

# Create three things to watch.
mkdir /test
mkdir /test/1
mkdir /test/2
mkdir /test/3

# Watch all three, fire event on 2, read watch, fire event on 1 and 3, ack 2.
1 watch /test/1 token1
1 watch /test/2 token2
1 watch /test/3 token3
2 write /test/2 contents2
expect 1:/test/2:token2
1 waitwatch
3 write /test/1 contents1
4 write /test/3 contents3
1 ackwatch token2
1 close
