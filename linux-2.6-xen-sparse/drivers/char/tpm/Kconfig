config TCG_TPM
	tristate "TPM Hardware Support"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && PCI
	---help---
	  If you have a TPM security chip in your system, which
	  implements the Trusted Computing Group's specification,
	  say Yes and it will be accessible from within Linux.  For
	  more information see <http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org>. 
	  An implementation of the Trusted Software Stack (TSS), the 
	  userspace enablement piece of the specification, can be 
	  obtained at: <http://sourceforge.net/projects/trousers>.  To 
	  compile this driver as a module, choose M here; the module 
	  will be called tpm. If unsure, say N.

config TCG_TIS
	tristate "TPM Interface Specification 1.2 Interface"
	depends on TCG_TPM
	---help---
	  If you have a TPM security chip that is compliant with the
	  TCG TIS 1.2 TPM specification say Yes and it will be accessible
	  from within Linux.  To compile this driver as a module, choose
	  M here; the module will be called tpm_tis.

config TCG_NSC
	tristate "National Semiconductor TPM Interface"
	depends on TCG_TPM
	---help---
	  If you have a TPM security chip from National Semicondutor 
	  say Yes and it will be accessible from within Linux.  To 
	  compile this driver as a module, choose M here; the module 
	  will be called tpm_nsc.

config TCG_ATMEL
	tristate "Atmel TPM Interface"
	depends on TCG_TPM
	---help---
	  If you have a TPM security chip from Atmel say Yes and it 
	  will be accessible from within Linux.  To compile this driver 
	  as a module, choose M here; the module will be called tpm_atmel.

config TCG_XEN
	tristate "XEN TPM Interface"
	depends on TCG_TPM && ARCH_XEN && XEN_TPMDEV_FRONTEND
	---help---
	  If you want to make TPM support available to a Xen
	  user domain, say Yes and it will
          be accessible from within Linux. To compile this driver
          as a module, choose M here; the module will be called
          tpm_xen.
