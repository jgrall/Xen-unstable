INSTRUCTIONS FOR BUILDING XENLINUX/IA64

1) In linux-2.6.9: (also tested with 2.6.10, 2.6.11.2)
	cp arch/ia64/configs/zx1_defconfig .config
2) vi .config
	unset CONFIG_IA32_SUPPORT
	unset CONFIG_IDE [for now, need to fix later]
	unset CONFIG_VIRTUAL_MEM_MAP [for now, need to fix later]
3) if running on ski, it is useful to make the following change:
   a) at the beginning of drivers/acpi/motherboard.c:acpi_reserve_resources()
      add the line:
	if (!acpi_gbl_FADT) return;
4) Build linux.
   a) yes "" | make oldconfig
   b) check the resulting .config to ensure there are no modules used (because
      Xen/ia64 doesn't support them yet).  Change '=m' to '=n' and remake
   c) yes "" | make oldconfig
   d) make
5) Linux must be "privified" to run on Xen/ia64.  This process converts all
   privilege-sensitive instructions into privileged instructions.
	Usage: privify infile outfile
   Privify is very dumb... it will not overwrite outfile.  It also prints
   out a bunch of useless info that can be safely ignored (except for "panic").
   The privify program can be obtained from:
	ftp://ftp.hpl.hp.com/pub/xen-ia64/privify
6) debug fixes:
   a) periodically xenlinux/ia64 goes into a fit of printing
      "Oops: timer tick before it is due..."  This can be changed
      in arch/ia64/kernel/time.c to either ignore it or print something
      shorter
   b) The hp simulator (ski) console drivers can be turned on to allow
      output of early boot information from xenlinux.  This results
      in some duplication of later output (which can be ignored).
      i) in linux/arch/ia64/Makefile, force the sim drivers by changing
		drivers-$(CONFIG_IA64_HP_SIM) += arch/ia64/hp/sim to
		drivers-y += arch/ia64/hp/sim
      ii) in linux/arch/ia64/hp/sim/Makefile, force the sim drivers
	  by changing obj-$(CONFIG_HP_SIMSERIAL) to obj-y and
          obj-$(CONFIG_HP_SIM_SERIAL_CONSOLE) to obj-y
      iii) in arch/ia64/kernel/setup.c:early_console_setup(), replace
           the contents of the routine with:
		extern struct console hpsim_cons;
		register_console(&hpsim_cons);
		return 0;
           (It may be necessary also to un-inline the routine, not sure.)
   c) It can be useful to modify linux/init/main.c to add a printf before
      or after a lot of the init calls
6) Start Xen from elilo, passing the Linux kernel as an initrd.
   NOTE: mca currently has a problem with binary translation,
   must run with "nomca" as a kernel argument
