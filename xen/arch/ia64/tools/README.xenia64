# Xen/ia64 heavily leverages/reuses many files from Linux/ia64
# however as of August 2005, all of these files are checked
# into the Xen tree so (if you remember doing so in the past)
# there is no need to fetch a copy of linux-2.6.x.tar.gz

# build xen/ia64
# if native
make

# or if using cross-compiler
make XEN_TARGET_ARCH=ia64
